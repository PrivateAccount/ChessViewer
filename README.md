## Purpose
* ChessViewer is a simple chess game viewer deployed on AWS Amplify (frontend) and AWS API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB (backend). It allows to view, analyze and interact with chess games, including making moves, viewing possible moves, and saving or loading games.
* It is designed to be a useful tool that allows users to configure game position by using tool panel in a such way:
  * **Delete** - for removing pieces (**D mode**)
  * **Edit** - for placing pieces (**E mode**)
  * **Stop** - for finishing configuration (back to **normal mode**)
* It has additional function - it allows to play chess against a computer opponent (**P mode**) or computer against computer demo (**C mode**).

## Description
* This web application handles the chess game logic and rules, including piece movement, game state management, and user interactions.
* It uses HTML elements to represent the chessboard and pieces, and it communicates with a backend API to save and load game states.
 
## Architecture 
* This web application is organized into several sections, including:
  * **Initialization**: Sets up the chessboard, pieces, and event listeners.
  * **Game Logic**: Handles the movement of pieces, checking for legal moves, and updating the game state.
  * **User Interface**: Manages the display of messages, game state, and user interactions.
  * **API Communication**: Interacts with a backend API to save and load game states.
  * **Event Handlers**: Responds to user actions, such as clicking on pieces or fields, and updates the game state accordingly.

* It includes features such as:
  * Chessboard setup with draggable pieces.
  * Piece movement and legal move checking.
  * Game state management (saving and loading games).
  * User interface for displaying game status and messages.
